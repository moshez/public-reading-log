Words of Radiance
-----------------

Obvious spoiler warning is obvious.


`Words of Radiance`_
is the second book in Brandon Sanderson Stormlight Archive series.
As always with Brandon Sanderson:

* There are a lot of interleaving stories
* The magic system is uniquely tailored to the environment.

This is the first series in which he has a non-human race,
the Parshendi/Parshmen.

If the previous book is the one where the characters who have powers
*discover*
them,
this book is about a
"coming out".
This book is the one that pays off most of the mysteries from the previous one --
the per-knights-radiant-order spren kind and how they relate to the power,
what are the shardblades
(dead spren except...),
why did Syl insist that the assassin in white is
*not*
a Knight radiant, etc.
