Duel

The book
Duel_
by David Grossman
was one of my favorite books as a kid.
I read it in the original Hebrew.
When I saw it was available
on Amazon
in English
for a ridiculous price,
I had to get it.

As soon as it arrived,
I read it in one seating.
No,
that's not accurate.
I read it in one
*standing*,
unable to tear myself away
long enough to find a chair.

This book is a lot like the
Lord of the Rings.
It's not exactly an
*unreliable*
narrator --
what the narrator says happened
probably did
"happen".
But it is a narrator who assumes
that it is
*their*
story which is important,
while it is really tangential
to the
"real"
plot.

The protagonist,
a tween kid,
is trying to stop a duel
between his elderly friend
and the friend's
college frenemy.
Unfortunately,
he is in way over his head.
The frenemies have a lot of history
together,
which includes dealing with
German anti-semitism,
escaping the holocaust,
and being dirt poor
in British-occupied Israel.

Reading this story as an adult,
I finally read the
real story between the lines.
A story about love,
conflict,
and struggling with a
secular Jewish identity
in a post-Holocaust world.

Everyone he meets has traumas
from the time between
the end of
World War II
and
to Israel becoming a state.
As a kid growing up in Israel,
the Holocaust was part of his
background knowledge,
which is part of the problem.
He assumes he understands it
because he has learned about it.

Yet,
just like the Hobbits in LotR,
he manages to save the day in
the nick of time.
Like the Hobbits,
he has had help that he barely
understood.

Duel is two books for the price of one:
one for kids,
and one for adults.
