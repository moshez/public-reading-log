Making Great Decisions
======================

This book_ is a weird mix:
it teaches important techniques for making good decisions
with the most horrifying example.

For example, it advises thinking carefully about the consequences of decisions.
It show cases this idea by talking about a time one of the author has
"hired away"
someone from a client,
and the client retaliated by refusing to work with him.
The person who was
"hired away",
presumably for more money,
has no role in this story except for an object.
How would he feel about the story about the regret the author feels
for offering him a well-paying well-deserved job?
Who cares!
