Existence
=========

Warning: Spoiler warning for David Brin's Existence.

This book_ is *not* part of the Upliftverse,
despite dolphins being uplifted.
This threw me for a loop,
but I guess Brin considers dolphin uplifting
to be an immutable part of the universe.

I have a lot of critiques of the science and tech aspect in this book.
Brin avoids them all by implying there's an answer and then never giving it,
so I cannot check to see the answer makes sense.

This is not the only cheap story telling trick in this book.
The most important part of the book happens "off camera":
there's a big conflict coming up,
then there's a time-skip,
and the conflict is in the past.

However,
the book does have twists.
A lot of them.
Good one.

Ultimately,
it is an entertaining book,
with good story-telling.
This is also the first book where the author self-insert character
is both minor and, arguably, villainish.
