Freakonomics
============

It's hard to say anything about this
book_
that has not already been said.
Yes, there are offensive bits there,
no matter who you are.
Definitely too many places where
"he"
is used as a neutral pronoun.

But all all of this fades as I enjoyed the author's unique taste --
the truth.
The drive to find out the hidden truth,
the true causality,
trying to eliminate any alternative hypothesis --
it's so much fun.

The Q&A ask what's left on the editing room floor.
The authors respond that few things are left on the editing room floor,
but a lot is left on the *research* floor.
If they can't find a story backed up by data,
they just don't publish it.
I believe it.
